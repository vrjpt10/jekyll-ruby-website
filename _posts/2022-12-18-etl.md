I constructed a responsive e-commerce website (similar to Amazon.com) from scratch, using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Bootstrap. The website's design ensured an excellent user experience, while the implementation of PHP facilitated efficient data collection from users during their interactions with the platform.

To handle the large volume of data generated by the e-commerce website, I developed a scalable and robust __ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system__. This system relied on both MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases, with PostgreSQL serving as the primary data extraction, transformation, and loading tool into the data warehouse. To ensure data quality and accuracy, I integrated essential data cleansing, validation, and normalization processes, allowing smooth integration of user data into the ETL pipeline.

To further add value to the data collected, I utilized __Tableau__ to generate compelling __data visualizations and analyses__. These insights provided invaluable information on consumer demographics, buying tendencies, and sales trends.
