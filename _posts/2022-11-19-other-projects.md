During my academic journey at NYU, I had the privilege of engaging in various exciting projects that not only expanded my knowledge but also provided invaluable hands-on experience. These projects encompassed diverse fields and allowed me to explore my passions, develop new skills, and collaborate with talented individuals. In this blog post, I am thrilled to share the details of some of these remarkable ventures.

1. __Gesture-Controlled Paper Piano using Computer Vision and Tkinter__: The virtual paper piano project involves the integration of Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter to create an interactive interface that responds to hand gestures, simulating the experience of playing a piano. By leveraging the webcam, the program detects and tracks hand gestures in real-time.

2. __Spotify Data Analysis__: Analysed 50 GB Spotify dataset using PySpark and performed feature extraction to derive various insights like popular genres, number of songs released every year, correlation between various features.

3. __Movie Recommendation System__: A system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and watching history, by analyzing patterns in user behavior and data on movies. The system could make personalized recommendations to individuals.

4. __Facial Expression Recognition__: Build and trained a CNN in Keras to recognize facial expressions. The objective was to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of the seven categories and serve the trained model predictions to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.

5. __Fake News Detection__: In this project, a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model was trained to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.

6. __Deepfake Detection__: Designed a novel Res-Next convolution neural network to detect whether the given video is deep faked or pristine. Trained the model on the Celeb Deep Fake and DFDC dataset specifically and tried to improve the accuracy by experimenting with the depth and width of the architecture.
