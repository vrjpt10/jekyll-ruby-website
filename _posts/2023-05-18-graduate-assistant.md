I worked as a graduate assistant at New York University's __Department of Computer Science and Engineering__ from October 2022 to May 2023. One of the highlights of my time as a graduate assistant was the invaluable sense of camaraderie that permeated the department. Every day, I had the pleasure of collaborating with a talented group of fellow graduate assistants, all driven by a common passion for computer science and engineering. Together, we formed a tight-knit team, working diligently to ensure that the needs of the undergraduate students were met efficiently and effectively.
