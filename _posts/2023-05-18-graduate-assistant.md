I worked as a __Graduate Assistant__ at New York Universityâ€™s __Department of Computer Science and Engineering__. I had the opportunity to support and guide more than 300 students in their academic journey. I provided dedicated doubt-clearing sessions and supervised exams for undergraduate courses, specifically __Data Structures and Algorithms__, as well as __Introduction to Programming__. It was an enriching experience to assist students in understanding complex concepts and helping them succeed in their coursework.
