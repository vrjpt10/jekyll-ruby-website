Embarking on my professional journey as a SEO Intern and then a __Software Engineer__, I had the privilege of working with YM Grad in India from June 2020 to July 2021. This valuable experience allowed me to showcase my skills and make a significant impact on the company’s digital presence and user experience. One of my key responsibilities was to boost the company’s website visibility and drive organic traffic. To achieve this, I delved into extensive research to identify high-potential keywords relevant to the industry. By implementing effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, I successfully increased the website’s organic traffic by an impressive 200%. I also contributed in creating an administration system that allows users to easily select service plans. This system enables basic operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting plans.
