During my time as a __Data Science Intern__ at __British Airways__, I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the company's data science efforts. I engaged in a variety of tasks that allowed me to harness the power of data and make valuable insights for the airline industry.

One of the primary responsibilities I undertook was conducting __web scraping__ to extract unstructured data from various sources. This data primarily consisted of customer reviews, which played a vital role in understanding customer sentiment and categorizing their feedback. By employing web scraping techniques, I gathered a substantial dataset of 20,000 customer reviews from the Skytrax review website.

To gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiments, I utilized the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model for __sentiment analysis__. This approach enabled me to comprehensively analyze the customer reviews, discern positive and negative sentiments, and identify key areas of concern for British Airways.

In addition to sentiment analysis, I was tasked with developing a classification model to __predict customer buying behavior__. By leveraging the power of __data cleaning and analysis__, I prepared the dataset and utilized machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost. These algorithms enabled me to create a robust predictive model with an impressive accuracy rate of over 85%.

My experience with British Airways as a data science intern allowed me to witness the tremendous impact that data-driven insights can have on the aviation industry. Through my contributions, I not only gained invaluable hands-on experience but also played a significant role in helping British Airways enhance their marketing strategies and customer satisfaction.
