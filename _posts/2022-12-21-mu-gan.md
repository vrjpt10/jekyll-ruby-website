I developed an extension architecture for a DC-GAN to enable music genre transfer. Using the GTZAN, FMA, and GACMIS datasets, I trained the model to generate raw music with various emotions and genres. To improve the quality of the synthesized music, I fine-tuned it for seven distinct genres using the Librosa library. As a result, I was able to produce genre-transferred music clips that last for more than 30 seconds, which can bypass copyright infringement claims. These clips underwent an adversarial modification process to ensure their uniqueness and avoid any legal issues.
