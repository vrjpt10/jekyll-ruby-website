Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers switch to other providers, can be a serious challenge for any business. In this project, I analysed customer data, of a whopping __96 GB__! The aim was to unravel the key factors driving customer churn and devise a powerful predictive model to foresee churn even before it happens. 

I started with __exploratory data analysis__. This process allowed us to dive deep into the data, unraveling hidden patterns, and spotting crucial indicators that influence customer churn. Next, using decision tree and random forest classifiers along with the principal component analysis, I created the __predictive model__. These advanced machine learning techniques acted as the trusty tools to construct a robust prediction model. And boy, did they deliver! The prediction model boasts an impressive accuracy of up to 94% in identifying potential churners!

To provide real-time access to churn predictions, I designed a __Flask application__ that enables businesses to predict customer churn with confidence! This nifty application provides seamless access to the churn prediction model, empowering businesses to take timely actions and retain their valuable customers.
